                <p class="bold">Why kitchen is so important?</p>
                We stopped to think about why this might be— here are five reasons that explain why your kitchen is the
                heart of your home.

                <p class="bold">Good for the mind, body and soul</p>
                Food nurtures the mind, body and soul. Without it, we would not survive. The kitchen provides a venue to
                store and prepare the food and nutrients our bodies need. Today, one in three American kids and teens
                are overweight or obese, triple the rate in 1963. In fact, childhood obesity is the number one health
                concern among parents in the United States, topping drug abuse and smoking. You want the best for your
                family, and it’s comforting to know you can help them develop healthy eating habits early in life that
                will bring lifelong benefits.

                <p class="bold">Family Fun in the Kitchen</p>
                Kitchens also provide a space for fun family activities. Cooking and baking with your family is a great
                bonding experience. It also gives everyone an opportunity to get a little messy, create new things and
                learn new recipes.

                <p class="bold">The Entire Family Uses It</p>
                In a home, there are many private rooms that only certain family members tend to utilize on a regular
                basis. Maybe dad loves his office, and the kids their playroom. However, each member of the family
                utilizes the kitchen every day. In recent years, families have begun to adapt their kitchens to provide
                a more supportive environment in which to congregate. For example, family computers have started to make
                their way into kitchens so kids can work on their homework while dinner is being made and parents can
                check a few items off their to-do list while still being in the kitchen with their loved ones. Because
                of this shift in kitchen dynamics, it is important your kitchen space is designed to be welcoming and
                conducive for family members to congregate.

                <p class="bold">It’s a Must-Have</p>
                Every home has a kitchen. It’s required. No other room other then the bathroom serves such a distinct
                purpose. Having a functional and modern kitchen is truly a blessing. It helps turn meal preparation into
                a pleasurable activity amidst the busy hustle and bustle of life.

                <p class="bold">It Sets the Tone</p>
                People invest a lot into kitchen upgrades because it is the most important room when it comes to the
                resale value of the home. Kitchens set the tone for the entire house. They have the ability to not only
                provide a meal but a complete experience. An inspiring space can mean the difference between a mediocre
                day and a fantastic day. For those not looking to renovate the entire kitchen, small upgrades can go a
                long way. Changing the cabinets and/or countertops can significantly transform the mood in the kitchen.
